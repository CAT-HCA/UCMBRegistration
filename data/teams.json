        "Description": "A\r\ntrumpet is a brass wind instrument noted for its powerful tone sounded by lip vibration against its cup-shaped\r\nmouthpiece. A trumpet consists of a cylindrical tube, shaped in a primary oblong loop that flares into a bell. Modern\r\ntrumpets also have three piston valves as well as small, secondary tubing that act as tuning slides to adjust the tone.\r\nAlmost all trumpets played today are B-flat. This is the tone naturally played when the trumpet is blown. They have a\r\nrange between the F-sharp below middle C to two and a half octaves above (ending at B), and are comparatively easier to\r\nplay than other brass instruments.",

        "Description": "The\r\ntrombone is a 15th-century development of the trumpet and, until approximately 1700, was known as the sackbut. Like a\r\ntrumpet, it has a cylindrical bore flared to a bell. Its mouthpiece is larger, however, suited to its deeper musical\r\nregister, and is parabolic in cross section, like a cornet. The slide is composed of two parallel and stationary inner\r\ntubes, thickened at their lower ends, and two movable outer tubes. The two sets of tubes are telescoped in and out by a\r\ncross stay manipulated by the player’s right hand. The other half of the trombone, the bell joint, passes over the\r\nplayer’s left shoulder, counterbalancing the weight of the slide. Its bend usually incorporates a tuning\r\nslide",

It is a piston-valve brass instrument with a bore that is mostly conical (like the higher pitched flugelhorn and alto (tenor) horn) but it has a narrower bore than the similarly pitched euphonium. It uses a wide-rimmed cup mouthpiece like that of its peers, the trombone and euphonium. Like the trombone and the euphonium, the baritone horn can be considered either a transposing or non-transposing instrument.",

        "Description": "A Brass instrument invented by composer and conductor John Philip Sousa, and the instrument maker J. W. Pepper (Philadelphia). The design was adapted from the tuba and the helicon. There were many helicons available at the time, including the 1883 Czerveny \"Kaiser Bass\" with a helicon shape. Sousa was happy enough with the sound of the helicon in a marching situation, but was looking for a mellower sound for his concert settings. In 1893, Pepper built an instrument that allowed the bell to be pointed upwards for the concert setting and forward for the march. He called it a sousaphone to thank Sousa for his suggestions.",

A musician who plays the flute can be referred to as a flute player, flautist, flutist or, less commonly, fluter or flutenist.",

        "Description": "Clarinets have the largest pitch range of common woodwinds.[9] The intricate key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range is defined by the keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B♭ clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of the B♭ clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B♭ clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.",
